# Neurogenetic_Traits_Outline_Vulnerability_to_Cortical_Disruption_in_Parkinsons_Disease
Codes corresponding to the manuscript "Neurogenetic Traits Outline Vulnerability to Cortical Disruption in Parkinson’s Disease" by Silvia Basaia, Federica Agosta, Ibai Diez, Elisenda Bueichekú, Federico d’Oleire Uquillas, Manuel Delgado-Alvarado, César Caballero-Gaudes, MariCruz Rodriguez-Oroz, Tanja Stojkovic, Vladimir S. Kostic, Massimo Filippi, and Jorge Sepulcre.

This repository is organized as follows:

1) RS-fMRI data processing was performed with the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State toolbox (DPARSFA, http://rfmri.org/DPARSF22), based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), and the RS-fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (see Image preprocessing section in the Supplementary materials for details).

2) dparsfa_mask_data.m: is a matlab script to generate a group probability mask.

3) compute_stepwise.m : is the main code of the manuscript for the construction of the association matrices and to compute stepwise functional connectivity (SFC) matrices.

4) creation_map_4_steps.m: is a matlab script to obtain a combined version of all SFC 1 to 4 maps into one single map.

5) average_maps.sh: is a bash script providing the averaging and the smoothing of all the combined maps.

6) compute_statistics.m: script used to perform statistical analyses
